<p>Many many years ago<br/>
when I was twenty three,<br/>
I got married to a widow<br/>
Who was pretty as could be.<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>This widow had a grown-up daughter<br/>
Who had hair of red.<br/>
My father fell in love with her,<br/>
And soon the two were&nbsp;wed.</p>
<p>This made my dad my son-in-law<br/>
And changed my very life.<br/>
My daughter was my mother,<br/>
For she was my father’s&nbsp;wife.</p>
<p>To complicate the matters worse,<br/>
Although it brought me joy,<br/>
I soon became the father<br/>
Of a bouncing baby&nbsp;boy.</p>
<p>My little baby then became<br/>
A brother-in-law to dad.<br/>
And so became my uncle,<br/>
Though it made me very&nbsp;sad.</p>
<p>For if he was my uncle,<br/>
Then that also made him brother<br/>
To the widow’s grown-up daughter<br/>
Who, of course, was my&nbsp;step-mother.</p>
<p>Father’s wife then had a son,<br/>
Who kept them on the run.<br/>
And he became my grandson,<br/>
For he was my daughter’s&nbsp;son.</p>
<p>My wife is now my mother’s mother<br/>
And it makes me blue.<br/>
Because, although she is my wife,<br/>
She’s my grandmother&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>If my wife is my grandmother,<br/>
Then I am her grandchild.<br/>
And every time I think of it,<br/>
It simply drives me&nbsp;wild.</p>
<p>For now I have become<br/>
The strangest case you ever saw.<br/>
As the husband of my grandmother,<br/>
I am my own&nbsp;grandpa!</p>

        <section class="about"><p>I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
