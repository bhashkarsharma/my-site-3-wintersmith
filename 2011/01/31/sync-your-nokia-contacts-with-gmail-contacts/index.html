<p>Hi fellas. So I have this Nokia S60 phone (5233) which, sadly, does not have support for Mail for Exchange ActiveSync. And that is the reason I started looking for alternatives to backup and sync my contacts and calendar.<span class="more"></span> An option that can serve the backup purpose is <a href="http://ovi.com/">Nokia Ovi</a> but that is limited to a backup and restore functionality and does not support any syncing with other services <span class="caps">AFAIK</span>, which didn’t help my purpose. So I started searching for other alternatives. Now, I don’t know whether any paid solutions work (assuming they exist) but yours truly was not looking for those. After running some queries on Google, I landed on some interesting solutions. And the one that worked for me, I’m sharing&nbsp;here: </p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Settings » Connectivity » Data transfer »&nbsp;Sync</li>
<li>Select ‘Options’ » ‘New sync&nbsp;profile’</li>
<li>A profile wizard will start, and would ask for a profile name. Just give a unique name such as ‘GMail sync’ and hit&nbsp;‘Next’</li>
<li>Now it would prompt you for a server version. Choose&nbsp;‘1.2’</li>
<li>Next, choose what you want to sync. In our case, it will just be&nbsp;‘Contacts’.</li>
<li>Now, the name of the Contacts database. Enter exactly ‘Contacts’ (without the&nbsp;quotes)</li>
<li>For Data bearer, choose&nbsp;‘Internet’</li>
<li>Host address next. Enter the <span class="caps">URL</span> ‘<a href="https://m.google.com/syncml">https://m.google.com/syncml</a>‘</li>
<li>Server <span class="caps">ID</span> will be&nbsp;‘Google’ </li>
<li>Port, if it prompts you for, would be&nbsp;‘443’ </li>
<li>Now for the login credentials: Username and Password. Just enter your Google account username and&nbsp;password.</li>
<li>Okay, we are good to go. Now choose ‘Save profile’. It will prompt you for whether this should be the active&nbsp;profile. </li>
</ol>
<p>Choose ‘Yes’. Now all you need to do is go to ‘Options’ »&nbsp;‘Synchronize’. </p>
<p>Once synchronization is complete, all your GMail contacts will be in sync with your phone contacts and vice-versa. Oh, and did I mention that includes the pics that people have set as their Google profile pic? Cool,&nbsp;huh? </p>
<p>Also, you can get push mail for your phone using Nokia Mail service, for which you might need to update your phone software. I updated my phone recently and is currently running V 21.1.102 dated 17-09-2010. Works beautifully for&nbsp;me. </p>
<p>The default Email app has inbuilt templates for GMail, Yahoo! mail, Hotmail, Rediffmail etc. And an option ‘others’, although I think very few would need to go there. I’m hoping it helps!&nbsp;:) </p>
<p>Take care. I will be back. Till&nbsp;then…</p>
