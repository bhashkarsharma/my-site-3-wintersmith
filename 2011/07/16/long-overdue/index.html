          <section class="content"><p>Tickle my ears and call me lazy, because that’s exactly what I’ve been the past couple of days. Not that I was not feeling guilty about not writing anything despite (trust me, I’m not lying) having 20 things in my head everyday that I could write about.<span class="more"></span> What was stopping me? Well, that’s the mystery and even I don’t think I have an answer to that one. Maybe you should try reading the first line again&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>So a lot has happened over the last few days. I’ve been super-busy with work and the Government has been its pathetic self with everything. Nothing unusual so far. I was agitated (and trust you me, I would have written a brash post about the incompetence and buffoonery that’s been going around in the Nation) on the day Mumbai had 3 blasts on Jul 13<span class="ord">th</span>. But as of now I’m trying to stay a bit clear of the bashing. Because for one thing, anger doesn’t yield anything. For another, the people who actually can make a big difference are, more often than not, ignorant and careless. And me swearing and boiling my blood is not that great an idea, given that I don’t have that much to spare to begin with&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a> released yesterday, and being the big fan that I am, was all the more excited especially because of it being the Finale. Luckily, I ended up going to watch it on Company outing with the interns for whom it was their last day of internship here. And most of them being <span class="caps">HP</span> fans themselves, it was good fun :) Before the movie, we went for their farewell lunch with almost the whole team. [I’m feeling a bit weird writing the above, just because of the reason that I’ve never maintained the blog as a journal per&nbsp;se]</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been having a lot of epiphanies (not new with me, but I think the frequency has increased a bit) For instance, even when every religion and book with a message tells us that Love is the most important thing on the planet, we still have so many people living with anger, pain and jealousy all the time. I wouldn’t go into the the details here. (For the philosophical souls: we can discuss this stuff at length&nbsp;offline)</p>
<p>Oops, I almost missed out on the fact that I got myself a domain (Yaayy!) So check out <a href="http://bhashkar.me/">http://bhashkar.me/</a> and let me know what you think. I’m still trying to figure out to make something good out of it. Will keep you&nbsp;posted.</p>
<p>So long, till&nbsp;then.</p>

I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
