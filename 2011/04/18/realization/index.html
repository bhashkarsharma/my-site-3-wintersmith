          <section class="content"><p>Squiggly. Funny word. But that’s beyond the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>In the past couple of days I’ve been feeling a little down. For no valid reason whatsoever. I guess most of it was just because things were not happening the way I wanted them to happen, and here’s the kicker, even though I wasn’t making any conscious effort to make them happen.<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>And tonight as I was about to retire for bed, I realized that (clever title, huh? I know. You can stop clapping now :D ) I was not following what I preach to others all the time. Just then it hit me that my biggest worries in life are not even worth being close to be categorized as worries, besides its nothing I can’t fix. While there are people in the World who are living in lack and limitation and still are able to smile. This means I’m just not respecting life the way I should. It is <span class="caps">THE</span> most wonderful gift of God. Every beautiful day comes up with a whole new set of possibilities and awesomeness. Choosing to ignore all the beauty just because someone tipped your scales a little bit is SO not worth&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Love is <span class="caps">THE</span> most amazing thing on the planet. I don’t know why people refrain from giving love. Maybe they’re afraid of getting hurt. But giving love is not the problem, expecting in return is. But then we are all humans and expecting comes naturally to us. If only we could live by Lord Krishna’s&nbsp;words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Karmanye Vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana,
Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhurmatey Sangostva&nbsp;Akarmani”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(translation: “You have a right to perform your prescribed action,but you are not entitled to the fruits of your action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results your activities, and never be associated to not doing your&nbsp;duty.”)</p>
<p>But I guess its way too tough for people to be living this way. After all, hope (for some people, its fear) is what keeps the ball rolling for us. And I guess there’s nothing wrong about that in today’s world. But tying your happiness to someone/something external is something we must try to&nbsp;avoid.</p>
<p>I know I’m good at telling others what is right, but when its time to follow it myself, I gotta keep a vigil eye on myself. I’ll leave you with one thought- “Miracles happen. You just have to be willing to see&nbsp;them.”</p>
<p>Bring it on,&nbsp;baby!</p>

        <section class="about"><p>I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
