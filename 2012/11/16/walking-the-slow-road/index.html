          <section class="content"><p>I took my ‘annual’ break at Deewali this year, and decided to stay completely out-of-touch from the internet. Here are my experiences.<span class="more"></span> Some of them might be&nbsp;super-obvious: </p>
<ol>
<li>The information superhighway with all its hustle and bustle combined with the fast-paced lifestyles of our times can give rise to some problems unforeseen in the previous times. For instance, there have been reports of ‘withdrawal symptoms’ in Facebook&nbsp;addicts.</li>
<li>Taking a detour from this overcrowded noisy road is not only useful, but most definitively necessary every once in a&nbsp;while.</li>
<li>‘Normal’ people don’t spend their days and nights checking Twitter and Hacker News&nbsp;streams.</li>
<li>One sad realization: Facebook has become the ‘high point’ in some people’s otherwise mundane lives, and hence, is acting as a&nbsp;drug.</li>
<li>There is humongous amounts of information being generated every second with the democratization of publishing media and the internet. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio has gone down tremendously. And sites like Facebook with their revenue generation mechanisms <a href="http://ninjasandrobots.com/facebook-pages-nest-thermostat">aren’t helping</a>.</li>
<li>It is almost impossible to believe that it was no longer than 7-8 years ago when we didn’t have to ‘stay forever connected’ and yet had fulfilling lives and relationships. I have reasons to believe that was good for a lot of reasons, for example, debates on some topics could last for hours without having a clear sense of ‘right directions’. Now most of the topics that you can do such debates on are the eternal ones, like philosophy or religion.
Overall, it was fun taking a break. I intend to take more of these shut-offs going forward (lasting weekends, for&nbsp;instance).</li>

        <section class="about"><p>I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
