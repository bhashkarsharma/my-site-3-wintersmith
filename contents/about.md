I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at [MobStac][1].

I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on [Quora][2], among other places.

The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.
