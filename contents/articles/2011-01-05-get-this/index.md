A Poem 

Many many years ago<br/>
when I was twenty three,<br/>
I got married to a widow<br/>
Who was pretty as could be.<span class="more"></span>

This widow had a grown-up daughter<br/>
Who had hair of red.<br/>
My father fell in love with her,<br/>
And soon the two were wed.

This made my dad my son-in-law<br/>
And changed my very life.<br/>
My daughter was my mother,<br/>
For she was my father's wife.

To complicate the matters worse,<br/>
Although it brought me joy,<br/>
I soon became the father<br/>
Of a bouncing baby boy.

My little baby then became<br/>
A brother-in-law to dad.<br/>
And so became my uncle,<br/>
Though it made me very sad.

For if he was my uncle,<br/>
Then that also made him brother<br/>
To the widow's grown-up daughter<br/>
Who, of course, was my step-mother.

Father's wife then had a son,<br/>
Who kept them on the run.<br/>
And he became my grandson,<br/>
For he was my daughter's son.

My wife is now my mother's mother<br/>
And it makes me blue.<br/>
Because, although she is my wife,<br/>
She's my grandmother too.

If my wife is my grandmother,<br/>
Then I am her grandchild.<br/>
And every time I think of it,<br/>
It simply drives me wild.

For now I have become<br/>
The strangest case you ever saw.<br/>
As the husband of my grandmother,<br/>
I am my own grandpa!
