Hey fellas! That's rite... We've moved. Now we're found chiefly on our homeblog... presence at other locations may or maynot be relevant. It'd be good if you check beforehand.. :P<span class="more"></span>
After going thru an export-import cycle; I finally managed to get my blog posts back to home... Then the tweaking of look-and-feel began and, I guess this is the outcome... for now!!

Today I got another awesome book from office.. God I so am in love with the Usability book that I already had... and now this frickin compendium of JS from O'Reilly... No wonder I love reading! :P
A bit of technical stuff: I apologize to all the frameworks which, I wrongly used to think, were no more than something that eases your work; which, for me, implicitly implied that only "aalsi" category of people would be using them.

Now that I have been using a few of the really great ones at work, I have come to realize that it is not only about the ease; it is about standardization, and super-efficient code-reuse... which, by the way, are key factors in today's application development scenarios.

My latest addiction: Two And A Half Men... n its hilarious, I tell ya!

With these changes and a couple of realizations regarding social networking and related phenomena, I guess I will be frequenting my blog and socializing sites more often than I previously used to..

If there's too much randomness in the text, pardon me for that. Word of the day: Entropy.

Ciao..
