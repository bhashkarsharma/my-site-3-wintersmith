I have been extremely lazy when it comes to being regular about writing, even though it happens to be my self-confessed hobby and dream to read, write and live amongst books for the rest of my life. That, and traveling.<span class="more"></span>

This is an attempt to put an end to the procrastination and get cracking. A shot in the dark, if you will. I've never put myself to a challenge publicly, till now.

I have been inspired (still wondering whether I'm ready to use that word) by many people, like the girl [who taught herself to dance in a year](http://www.danceinayear.com/story/), or this person [who is making a website everyday](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/); and this guy, [who can write stories almost magically fast](http://www.theawl.com/2013/09/i-was-a-hated-hipster-meme-and-then-it-got-worse).

The content I write will mostly be my thoughts, maybe a short story, or my take on anything going on around me. At this point, even writing a single line everyday counts. I remember reading this rule, saying something to the tune of, "if you really want to do something, but it keeps getting sidetracked, start with 2 minutes everyday". And that's what I'm going to do.

Let's see how it turns out.
