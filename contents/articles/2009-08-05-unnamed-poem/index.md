Hi Fellas! Following is something that I came up with during the time my precious YearBook was under construction. Although I couldn't make it very complete or appealing, yet thought it best to post it here, so it can be read by you:<span class="more"></span>

This world around me,<br />
its fun 2 b in.<br />
As i fight 2 stay awake,<br />
midst of my day,<br />
rough as it is,<br />
ain't no piece of cake.

Define love- the toughest question of all times,<br />
comes to haunt me. Sick as it is,<br />
this world is love-stricken.<br />
The existence of a new paradigm<br />
of operability, adds a flavor<br />
of tranquility<br />
which is why love is referred to as<br />
God in some places n the inexplicable<br />
in others.<br />
But one thing that persists<br />
is the purity n sanctity<br />
that true love holds.

<br />
Also, following is a lovely song featured in Scrubs episode 201. The song is called 'Overkill' and features Colin Hay in the video. You can also see the video on YouTube [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JPzi1Su9T4).

I can't get to sleep<br />
I think about the implications<br />
Of diving in too deep<br />
And possibly the complications

Especially at night<br />
I worry over situations<br />
I know I'll be alright<br />
Perhaps it's just imagination

Day after day it reappears<br />
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear<br />
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets<br />
Only brings exasperation<br />
It's time to walk the streets<br />
Smell the desperation

At least there's pretty lights<br />
And though there's little variation<br />
It nullifies the night from overkill

Day after day it reappears<br />
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear<br />
Ghosts appear and fade away<br />
Come back another day

I can't get to sleep<br />
I think about the implications<br />
Of diving in too deep<br />
And possibly the complications

Especially at night<br />
I worry over situations<br />
I know I'll be alright<br />
It's just overkill

Day after day it reappears<br />
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear<br />
Ghosts appear and fade away<br />
Ghosts appear and fade away<br />
Ghosts appear and fade away.
