And when I say NEVER, I mean NEVER. Although you should '[Never](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z5-P9v3F8w&ob=av3e) Say [Never](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aihu16RyYp8)' :P <span class="more"></span>

But in this case I will. For the simple reason that a <space> character in the source of folder which Eclipse was running from made me waste a couple of my hours spread over 2 days to figure out what on the Earth was going on. It included reinstalling Pydev, Â and at one point of time I actually considered reinstalling Eclipse. Then while checking out the error logs it suddenly hit me. I fixed it and Voila! There it was. Working the way it should have. 

A suggestion to *NIX based OS developers: Please don't give the default folder name such that it causes problems. Peace is restored to the World :)
