Forbes is [counting](http://www.forbes.com/sites/briancaulfield/2012/07/27/aol-unit-techcrunch-q2-adjusted-f-bomb-production-down-45/) the number of fucks TechCrunch gives; and TC [hits back](http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/27/fornicating-under-consent-of-the-king/).<span class="more"></span>

I found the whole episode amusing; specially the fact that they related it to [Arrington](http://uncrunched.com), [Siegler](http://parislemon.com/)Â and [Carr](https://www.nsfwcorp.com) leaving TC.

Anyway, here's a little something for you. After all, this is what the [internets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internets) are all about, no?
