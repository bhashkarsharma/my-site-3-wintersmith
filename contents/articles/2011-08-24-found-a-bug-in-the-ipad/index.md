The Photos app hanged when I was moving photos around, zooming in and out. Has something to do with multi-touch. <span class="more"></span>

Googled it and found lots of people cribbing about the same on the Apple Forum :P Following is the screenshot after which I wasn't able to do anything in the app. Had to close it and reboot the iPad. Did someone just scream 'Windows'? :P !
