Every once in a while, I used to come across this phrase (although the frequency has now diminished and gave way toÂ _enter-successful-product_-killer in recent times). Since 2007 there have been at least 20 so-called iPhone killers, and every few days we get to see a new self-proclaimed Facebook/Instagram/Google killer.<span class="more"></span>

Talking specifically about the Internet, I personally think that there is one Killer app: The Browser. It has existed since the text-only web days and moved into the primarily-mobile age of today without so much as flinching. Undeniably, a ton of native apps keep coming everyday which might provide a better experience than the browser (thanks to HTML5, that gap is closing fast) but most of them are 'easy come, easy go'.

Google has been working hard on something. Is it a browser? Is it an OS? It's Google's [Chrome OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS).

Not that it needs to be said, but the browser is here to stay. And I can't wait to play an upcoming version of Need For Speed on my browser. Far fetched? I'm choosing to stay optimistic ;)
