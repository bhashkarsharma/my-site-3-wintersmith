_[The title is the first password mentioned in Harry Potter books]_

I have always been paranoid about security, but in the last few weeks the paranoia has increased, especially since I read how [hackers almost entirely erased the digital life of Mat Honan](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/).<span class="more"></span> [Here's the [follow-up articles on how he got (a part of) his data back](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/mat-honan-data-recovery/all/) and then about [catching the hacker](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/09/cosmo-the-god-who-fell-to-earth/all/)]

Google has done a great job by providing two-step verification. [Here's how you can use it](http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=180744). I wish more services would provide such security-enhancing solutions. So today I set sail searching for the best ways to create passwords which are hard to guess and yet easily memorable by humans. I didn't want to use a software/service for it because it tends to limit the number of places you can use the service to enter the password (apps on phones/tablets, for instance). I understand that they are a much safer way to go, but the dependency was something I wanted to stay clear of. For those interested in such software solutions, please check out [roboform](http://www.roboform.com), [lastpass](https://lastpass.com) and [gringotts](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Gringotts) :D

Instead of trying to explain what has already been explained, and in ways much better than I possibly can, I'll share the links with you. 

  1. [Jeff Atwood's](http://twitter.com/codinghorror) famous post about [Passwords vs Pass Phrases](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/07/passwords-vs-pass-phrases.html)
  2. Microsoft's [guidelines](http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx) and [password security checker](https://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/password-checker.aspx)
  3. [Soundpuzzle](http://www.soundpuzzle.com/passwords.html) has one
  4. And then there's [diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)


For those interested in numbers, here' [the analysis of how ATM PIN numbers are spread](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html) across the possible 10,000 values (0000 - 9999) Hopefully yours is not one of the top 20.

And here's an awesome [XKCD post about password security](http://xkcd.com/936/) :) Be safe. Peace.
