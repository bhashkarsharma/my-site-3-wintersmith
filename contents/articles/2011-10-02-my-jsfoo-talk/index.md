So I got the opportunity to talk at [jsFoo 2011](http://jsfoo.hasgeek.com) organized by [HasGeek](http://twitter.com/hasgeek) which also happened to be my first talk since college.<span class="more"></span> Following is my presentation uploaded to SlideShare:

The topic of my talk was 'Client-side rendering using [mustache.js](http://mustache.github.com/)' which is the nifty technique we have used in building [Touchsites](http://mobstac.com) at MobStac.

I had fun at the event listening to other speakers and socializing with the people attending the event. I'm definitely looking forward to similar events. Feel free to contact me for more information :)
