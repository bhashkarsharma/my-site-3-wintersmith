Most of us are living life in the fast lane. A life which is more of a race than a journey. We are competing with each other to get ahead and reach somewhere. But where?

Take a moment and think of all that we have missed out on because of being in the race mindset.<span class="more"></span>

I love nature; listening to the sounds of birds chirping, water flowing, rain falling. I don't remember the last time I was at a place so peaceful where I could listen to them.

I love to take long strolls and jog on empty roads. I don't get to see empty roads even at 1AM nearby.

I love to be near greenery. This is something I'm not entirely deprived of, thanks to the area that I live in.

I can't recall the last time I was able to lie down in the warm sun on a winter day and enjoy a nap.

I love to read, and write. I love to create new and beautiful stuff. I love to let my imagination fly. I love music. These are some things I am able to do, and I'm extremely grateful about them.

"Slow down and smell the roses" is not just a phrase. It is an advice that we should heed to every once in a while by taking time out of our packed schedule.

With the omnipresent miniature computers that we carry around in our pockets, we have lost the touch of human connection; when ironically these devices were supposed to bring us closer, to make us more efficient so we can get more time to ourselves and those important to us. People sitting around a table having lunch are lost in their devices, forgetting the people in front of them.

We have become zombies, screen junkies seeking attention from our online networks; while ignoring the human-ness of connecting with someone next to us.

Here's an amazing comic (click on the image to read):

Life is a series of moments, each following the other. If we postpone our happiness till a wish is fulfilled, we are limiting our happiness. Given the unpredictability of life, does it not make sense to be happy and grateful for what we have? Don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about compromising and limiting ourselves. I'm talking about making the best of what we have.

Dream big and aim to achieve the best, work as hard as you can; but don't keep your happiness locked away till you get what you want. Be happy about the smallest things, be it a baby smiling across the street or a tasty flavor of ice cream you recently discovered, or a mind-blowing song that you came across.
