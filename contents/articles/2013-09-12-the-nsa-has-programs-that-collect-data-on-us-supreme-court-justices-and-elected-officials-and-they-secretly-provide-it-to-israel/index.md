[Latest Snowden revelation](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents) makes things look as if the NSA was being run by Israel all along.<span class="more"></span>

Thanks to Snowden, we now know the NSA:

  * Had James Clapper lie under oath to us - on camera - to Congress to hide the domestic spying programs [Occured in March, revealed in June](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/350699/clappers-lie-charles-c-w-cooke).

  * Warrantlessly accesses records of every phone call that routes through the US thousands of times a day [June](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order)[September](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/nsa-broke-rules-call-tracking-96571.html)

  * Steals your private data from every major web company (Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, et al) via PRISM[June](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data) and pays them millions for it [August](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/nsa-prism-costs-tech-companies-paid)

  * Pays major US telecommunications providers (AT&T, Verizon, et al) between $278,000,000-$394,000,000 annually to provide secret access to all US fiber and cellular networks (in violation of the 4th amendment). [August](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-paying-us-companies-for-access-to-communications-networks/2013/08/29/5641a4b6-10c2-11e3-bdf6-e4fc677d94a1_story.html)

  * Intentionally weakened the encryption standards we rely on, put backdoors into critical software, and break the crypto on our private communications [September](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&)

  * NSA employees use these powers to spy on their **US citizen** lovers via LOVEINT, and only get caught if they self-confess. Though this is a felony, none were ever been charged with a crime. [August](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests/)

  * **Lied** to us again just ten days ago, claiming they never perform economic espionage (whoops!) before a new leak revealed that they do all the time. [September](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/09/nsa-spying-brazil-oil-petrobras)

  * Made over fifteen thousand false certifications to the secret FISA court, leading a judge to rule they "frequently and systemically violated" court orders in a manner "directly contrary to the sworn attestations of several executive branch officials," that **90%** of their searches were unlawful, and that they "repeatedly misled the court." [September](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/nsa-violated-court-rules-data-documents) [September](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/09/10/five-revelations-from-new-nsa-documents/?mod=e2tw)

  * **Has programs that collect data on US Supreme Court Justices and elected officials, and they secretly provide it to Israel regulated only by an honor system.** [September](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents)
