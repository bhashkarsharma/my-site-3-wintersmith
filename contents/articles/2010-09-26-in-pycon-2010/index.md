_[This post has been imported from my blogspot blog, where it looked a bit misplaced to me considering the fact that I post my ramblings there. Besides, this does the job of first tech-post that I needed to write. For sanity's sake, I have kept the same publishing date as on the original post. A few enhancements have been made to the post. Have fun.]_ 

I've just got back from InPyCon'2010.<span class="more"></span> 

Was my first time being to a Technology Convention, and not too bad an experience. Although I had expected it to be at a different level thinking that this is The PyCon (meaning the International version) but being what it actually was, it was fine, I must say. Needless to say, being the love of my life; graphics, animation and UX if brought together, I don't think  there is anything more interesting and intriguing to me as a technologist. And that was precisely what happened at InPyCon. (Actually, this was the only interesting part of the conention I actually enjoyed) 

There were two things which I came across today which have got me fantasizing (don't get the wrong idea ;) ) and kept me awake at 3 in the morning (this can explain how excited I am!) writing this blog post. :) 

I've uploaded this video to make some sense out of all the gibberish I've been shooting till now (think: low cost VR and touch panels :) ). If you find it interesting, you might also want to visit [the presenter's site](http://asimmittal.net/). 

I'm also taking the liberty to include the link to [the source](http://www.johnnylee.net/) of his inspiration.

The other presentation that I really had fun at was the one about 3D Game development in [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) which is a Python based gaming-engine-cum-IDE. Think about it. Free. Open source. And allows you to build 3D games. And did I mention that you don't need to write code for that? That's right, my friend! I'm definitely gonna get my hands dirty with it. (Takes a while to get acquainted with the tools, I hear, but nevertheless, worth a shot all the same!) :) Enjoy!! 

Post comments. I, in the meanwhile, will try to get things moving in the direction where I can put all this knowledge to good use.

Ciao for now!
