I'm not pointing fingers, but iOS 6 is stripping off Google search referrer data.<span class="more"></span> No, doesn't seem to be an OS bug; Bing data is preserved ([read more here](http://searchengineland.com/ios-6-removes-all-google-search-referer-data-134560)).

I might be wrong, but you can't ignore the big picture. Take this, and add to it the fact that Apple bid goodbye to Google Maps in its latest iOS update and you can start getting a clearer indication of things to come.

[Siegler puts it well](http://massivegreatness.com/squeeze-my-hand). While you are at it, [take notice](http://massivegreatness.com/mobile). Listen to what [Marissa Mayer is telling Yahoo!](http://www.businessinsider.com/here-is-the-plan-marissa-mayer-just-announced-to-yahoo-employees-2012-9) now. Or as we put it at [MobStac](http://mobstac.com),  Mobile is the new web. Also, [check out what iOS6 maps shows you](http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/).

And here's the customary dose of fun:
