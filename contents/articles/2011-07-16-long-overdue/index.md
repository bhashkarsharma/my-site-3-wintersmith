Tickle my ears and call me lazy, because that's exactly what I've been the past couple of days. Not that I was not feeling guilty about not writing anything despite (trust me, I'm not lying) having 20 things in my head everyday that I could write about.<span class="more"></span> What was stopping me? Well, that's the mystery and even I don't think I have an answer to that one. Maybe you should try reading the first line again :P

So a lot has happened over the last few days. I've been super-busy with work and the Government has been its pathetic self with everything. Nothing unusual so far. I was agitated (and trust you me, I would have written a brash post about the incompetence and buffoonery that's been going around in the Nation) on the day Mumbai had 3 blasts on Jul 13th. But as of now I'm trying to stay a bit clear of the bashing. Because for one thing, anger doesn't yield anything. For another, the people who actually can make a big difference are, more often than not, ignorant and careless. And me swearing and boiling my blood is not that great an idea, given that I don't have that much to spare to begin with :P

In other news, [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/) released yesterday, and being the big fan that I am, was all the more excited especially because of it being the Finale. Luckily, I ended up going to watch it on Company outing with the interns for whom it was their last day of internship here. And most of them being HP fans themselves, it was good fun :) Before the movie, we went for their farewell lunch with almost the whole team. [I'm feeling a bit weird writing the above, just because of the reason that I've never maintained the blog as a journal per se]

Recently I've been having a lot of epiphanies (not new with me, but I think the frequency has increased a bit) For instance, even when every religion and book with a message tells us that Love is the most important thing on the planet, we still have so many people living with anger, pain and jealousy all the time. I wouldn't go into the the details here. (For the philosophical souls: we can discuss this stuff at length offline)

Oops, I almost missed out on the fact that I got myself a domain (Yaayy!) So check out http://bhashkar.me/ and let me know what you think. I'm still trying to figure out to make something good out of it. Will keep you posted.

So long, till then.
