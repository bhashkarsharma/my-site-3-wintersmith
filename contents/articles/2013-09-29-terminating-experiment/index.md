A few days ago, I started this experiment. The goal was to write a post everyday. I have to say I have failed miserably at keeping that goal up. I have barely been able to write 6 posts. But then, I guess it is not easy writing everyday especially when you have other things on hand.

I will change this goal to be once a week (will aim for more frequently than that). A week is a reasonable amount of time to come up and compose a good write-up.

Can't express how let down I feel.
