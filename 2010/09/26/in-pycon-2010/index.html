          <section class="content"><p><em>[This post has been imported from my blogspot blog, where it looked a bit misplaced to me considering the fact that I post my ramblings there. Besides, this does the job of first tech-post that I needed to write. For sanity’s sake, I have kept the same publishing date as on the original post. A few enhancements have been made to the post. Have&nbsp;fun.]</em> </p>
<p>I’ve just got back from InPyCon’2010.<span class="more"></span> </p>
<p>Was my first time being to a Technology Convention, and not too bad an experience. Although I had expected it to be at a different level thinking that this is The PyCon (meaning the International version) but being what it actually was, it was fine, I must say. Needless to say, being the love of my life; graphics, animation and <span class="caps">UX</span> if brought together, I don’t think  there is anything more interesting and intriguing to me as a technologist. And that was precisely what happened at InPyCon. (Actually, this was the only interesting part of the conention I actually&nbsp;enjoyed) </p>
<p>There were two things which I came across today which have got me fantasizing (don’t get the wrong idea ;) ) and kept me awake at 3 in the morning (this can explain how excited I am!) writing this blog post.&nbsp;:) </p>
<p>I’ve uploaded this video to make some sense out of all the gibberish I’ve been shooting till now (think: low cost <span class="caps">VR</span> and touch panels :) ). If you find it interesting, you might also want to visit <a href="http://asimmittal.net/">the presenter’s site</a>. </p>
<p>I’m also taking the liberty to include the link to <a href="http://www.johnnylee.net/">the source</a> of his&nbsp;inspiration.</p>

</div>

<p>The other presentation that I really had fun at was the one about 3D Game development in <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> which is a Python based gaming-engine-cum-<span class="caps">IDE</span>. Think about it. Free. Open source. And allows you to build 3D games. And did I mention that you don’t need to write code for that? That’s right, my friend! I’m definitely gonna get my hands dirty with it. (Takes a while to get acquainted with the tools, I hear, but nevertheless, worth a shot all the same!) :)&nbsp;Enjoy!! </p>
<p>Post comments. I, in the meanwhile, will try to get things moving in the direction where I can put all this knowledge to good&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Ciao for&nbsp;now!</p>

I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
