          <section class="content"><p>This has been a question I have come across many times, and must say, is not a pointless one. I have been asked this by my friends many times I discuss an idea with them, and Google told me that <a href="http://whatifgoogledoesit.com/">many VCs do it</a> too.<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I have always loved Google. For their culture, for the simple <span class="caps">UI</span> of their products, for supporting open technologies, for providing high-quality products (mostly) for free, unless you are a power user; and for tackling big problems. Theoretically, many of those things are still valid. But there is a problem. I am no longer a student, and when I pick a product, especially for professional use, I have to know that it will work, I will get the support in case I need it; and most importantly, it will still be around 6 months or 2 years from now. That is where this argument has started faltering&nbsp;lately.</p>
<p>I’m sure Google is not abandoning GMail anytime soon. But can I be certain about things like Blogger, Calendar, or Feedburner? Not with certainty, I suppose. They’ll notify us in their Spring Cleaning updates and give time to export the data, but I still don’t see why shouldn’t I just stick to a company that is focused on that one&nbsp;product.</p>
<p>If you want to do something they are already doing, I think you should not let this fact be the sole deterrent, as long as you know there is a market and you know that you can provide a solid product and good&nbsp;support.</p>

        <section class="about"><p>I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
