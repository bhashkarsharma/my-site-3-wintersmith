          <section class="content"><p>I have been a fan of self-help books in the past.<span class="more"></span> I definitely have learned some things that help me live my life slightly better because of having read those books, but here’s the trick: most of the things that are mentioned in those books are rather obvious. They do have a fancy way of putting down the obvious, and a story or two in tow to aggrandize the&nbsp;effect. </p>
<p>Being an utterly curious creature, I tend to ask myself questions which might sound strange or stupid to most. Almost every time such a question has sent me down a rabbit hole and helped me figure out a thing or two that I wasn’t previously aware&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>At one point, that is what I thought I should take up as a profession - helping people figure out their lives. But as I have learned and grown; I’ve realized two&nbsp;things:</p>
<ol>
<li>People don’t realize things unless they actively search for the answers themselves. You can’t spoonfeed&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>There’s too much of show and shady stuff in this field. I would steer clear of becoming a part of&nbsp;it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not to mention that I am still trying to figure my own life out, and I don’t think that I qualify to “coach” others yet. I realize that life is a journey and the entire process is about figuring things out, learning from and enjoying the experiences, one day at a&nbsp;time.</p>

        <section class="about"><p>I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
