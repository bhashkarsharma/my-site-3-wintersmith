          <section class="content"><p>On reading <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-02-28/tesla-is-a-car-not-a-revolution">this article</a>, many things come to mind; and not just how it screams “sensationalism” and “nay-sayer” out loud.<span class="more"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.bloomberg.com/image/iUVPBRrLZNPg.jpg" alt="Stunning, indeed!"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Musk is headed for a “stunning fail” - Edward&nbsp;Niedermeyer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Nostradamus takes a series of arguments, adds layers of “if this then that” on top, and tries to create a straw&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>Even in my sleep I could smell oil on this article. Musk was a newcomer into the payments industry and he re-invented things with PayPal. SpaceX is the first private company in the world that has been able to successfully go farther than government agencies like <span class="caps">NASA</span>, and at a cheaper&nbsp;cost.</p>
<p>People said the idea that Tesla could begin shipping the Model S to customers in 2012 was absurd, that they were naive and didn’t understand the complexities of building a vehicle like Detroit&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>Before that, everyone said nobody would buy electric vehicles because (a) you can’t get them over 100 miles in range, and (b) because there is no charging&nbsp;infrastructure.</p>
<p>I would rather live in a world where a man like Musk is pushing the realm of possibilities to the next level as opposed to one in which he joins the rest of us hoping for some miracle to come out of the behemoth car (or any other) industry which hasn’t really done much to innovate in fields like&nbsp;energy.</p>
<p>Even if it happens to be a “stunning fail”, it would be more glorious and would have changed the world more than most others in their entire&nbsp;lifetime.</p>

        <section class="about"><p>I love the web and open-source; and enjoy building useful things.
I have had the opportunity to give talks on JS-related things we built at <a href="http://mobstac.com">MobStac</a>.</p>
<p>I love books; and sometimes try to write. I enjoy sharing my learnings on <a href="http://quora.com/Bhashkar-Sharma">Quora</a>, among other places.</p>
<p>The excitement of learning new things is the reason I get out of bed in the morning.</p>
